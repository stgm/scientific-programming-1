# Number Theory (level 1)

Verifying theoretical hypotheses by hand is often times a time consuming job and a computer lends itself quite well to this purpose. Mathematical intuition required!

But why programming? Check out the video. [Mirjam Leunissen](http://www.dutchdatadesign.nl) creates data visualizations for the [Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/kijkverder/2015/klimaatkennis/) among others. She shares her experiences with programming and creating visualizations.

##### Day 1: Getting started

1. Practice thoroughly with the [basic elements](/numbers/basics) of Python

2. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Program the computer to be a [number whiz](/numbers/whiz)

##### Day 2: Prime numbers

1. Lear more about [algorithms](/numbers/algorithms)

3. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Look for [prime numbers](/numbers/primes)

##### Day 3: Number theory

1. Store data in a [list](/numbers/lists)

2. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Look for the [longest sequence non-primes](/numbers/sequence)

3. Understand how to write ["good code"](/numbers/style-guide) --- and from now on we expect you to implement these guidelines!

4. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Try to (dis)prove [Goldbach's](/numbers/goldbach) conjecture

##### Day 4: Plotting graphs

1. Learn how to use [modules](/numbers/modules) in Python

2. Find out how to [plot](/numbers/plotting)

3. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Make data intelligible by [plotting graphs](/numbers/plot)

##### Optional: Co-primes

We expect you to fully implement and submit the assignments above. But there's also an optional assignment, intended to be done by anyone who feels ready to do more! In this module, you'll test theorems from number theory about the frequency of [co-prime pairs](/numbers/co-primes).


##### Evaluation

Have you submitted each problem from this module? Then you're done! Please fill out the [evaluation form](https://goo.gl/forms/gwRSgA3bBnpcAkME2){:target="_blank"}. It's important for us to get feedback on the course's content.
