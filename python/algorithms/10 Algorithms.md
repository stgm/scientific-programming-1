# Algorithms

Computers truly shine when the solution to a problem cannot (or is hard to) be expressed by a formula. Programmers work to devise and implement *algorithms*, that exactly specify the step-by-step plan to solve a problem. An important aspect of algorithms is that they have to work for different inputs. In the video below the algorithm has to find the correct solution if there are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or more people in the room.

In the chapter [basics](/python/basics) you've learned a number of **instructions** that can be used in Python:

- the `print`-instruction, to display messages to the user
- the `input`-instruction, to process information from the user
- the `=`-operator, to define and manipulate variables

Aside from that, you've gotten acquainted with operators that are used to comprise expressions. This was already enough to write a functional program. Now we're going to make things more interesting by introducing exceptions and repetition.
