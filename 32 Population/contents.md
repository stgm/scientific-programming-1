In this module we'll simulate the population dynamics of 25 rabbits and 2 foxes, living in a secluded forest.A classical predator-prey model with a variety of elements and an animation.

First, take a look at the video to the side. [Iko Koevoets](http://www.uva.nl/over-de-uva/organisatie/medewerkers/content/k/o/i.t.koevoets/i.t.koevoets.html) is promoting ath the UvA and studies the development of plant roots. That ensues a bunch more data processing than one would expect!

#### Day 1: Animations in Python

1. Learn how to make [animations](/resources/animations) in Python

2. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> The [spiraling dot](/movement/dot)

3. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Show how a [drunk student](/movement/student) moves around

#### Day 2: Rabbits in a forest

1. <span class="label label-primary">Assignment</span> Animate 25 [rabbits](/population/rabbits) living in a forest

#### Day 3: Add (hungry) foxes to the forest

1. <span class="label label-primary">Assignment</span> Add (vegetarian) [foxes](/population/foxes) to the simulation

2. <span class="label label-primary">Assignment</span> The foxes develop a penchant for meat. Touch luck for the [rabbits]](/population/foxeseatrabbits)

#### Day 4: The rabbits reproduce - who wins?

1. <span class="label label-primary">Assignment</span> Let the rabbits reproduce and find out who [wins](/population/rabbitsreproduce), rabbits or foxes
