# Monopoly

After s short introduction with animating in Python, we'll spend the first 3 days of this module on simulating the game of Monopoly. It is impossible to do so analytically, because the use of dice adds a complicated element of chance to the game. Game theory in practice.

During day 4 we'll get acquainted with simulating a physical phenomonon: free fall (with and without friction).

#### Day 1: Animations and the start of Monopoly

1. Learn how to make [animations](/resources/animations) in Python

2. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> The [spiraling dot](/movement/dot)

3. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Show how a [drunk student](/movement/student) moves around

4. Read up on [Monopoly](/monopoly/introduction)

5. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Monopoly with one player in [Donald Trump mode](/monopoly/moving-around)


#### Day 2: Monopoly - starting money

1. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Effect of a finite amount of [starting money](/monopoly/startingmoney) on the game


#### Day 3: Monopoly - $$2^nd$$ player and finding an equilibrium

1. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Add a second player and restore the [equilibrium](/monopoly/two-players)


#### Day 4: Simulating physics: gravity

1. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Study the movement of a falling [apple](/movement/apple)
