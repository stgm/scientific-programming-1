# Monte Carlo

It is possible to approximate an integral by using random numbers.

1.  Define a rectangle that surrounds the integral area

    Define an area (often times a rectangle) that surrounds the integral area. So you have to choose a $$x_{min}$$, $$x_{max}$$, $$y_{min}$$ and $$y_{max}$$ such that:

      - $$x_{min} \leq a$$ and $$x_{max} \geq b​$$

      - for $$a \leq x \leq b$$ : $$y_{min} \leq f(x)  \leq y_{max}$$

    Choose the tightest rectangle with $$x_{min} = a$$ and $$x_{max} = b$$.

2.  Generate random points within the rectangle

    Generate a large number of random numbers $$(x_i, y_i)$$ in the rectangle that surrounds the integral area and verify for each point whether it lies 'within' the integral area ('good') or not ('wrong'). Keep track of the fraction of points within the integral area: $$f_{good}​$$.

3.  Determine the integral

    The integral is the fraction of points generated within the graph times the total surface of the rectangle ('box').
    In case of a rectangle the integral is given by:

    $$
        \int_a^b f(x)~dx = f_{good}~~\cdot~(x_{max}-x_{min})\cdot(y_{max}-y_{min})
    $$

## Example

It is known that the function $$sin(x)$$ is enclosed on the domain $$0 < x < \pi$$ between 0 and 1. So we defined a box around the integral area and generated 2000 random points. Of which 63.15% (1263/2000) appeared to be within the integral area. The approximation that we've made of the integral using these 2000 is subsequently: 0.6315$$\pi \approx 1.984​$$. When this method is implemented correctly, we can effortlessly generate 1 million points instead of 2000.
