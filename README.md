# Introduction to Scientific Programming part 1

In this course you'll get to know Python, a programming language that is often used to do science. There are four levels in the course:

- Basic elements of programs
- Functions and algorithms
- Simulations
- Small data processing

Note that the course is online at <https://sp1.mprog.nl/>. This repository hosts the source materials, mostly written in Markdown.

The course was created by Martijn Stegeman (<mailto:martijn@stgm.nl>) and Ivo van Vulpen (<mailto:ivo.van.vulpen@nikhef.nl>). We have had a lot of help from students over the years, who took the course, but also teachers and teaching assistants who contributed their own ideas and corrections. In particular, we would like to thank:

- Jelle van Assema (assignments and checkpy tools)  
- Marianne de Heer Kloots (revisions and testing)  
- Maarten Inja (assignment)  
- Huub Rutjes (films)
- Luca Verhees (semester of code artwork)
- Vera Schild (tests and checkpy contributions)
- Quinten van der Post (translation into English)
- Marleen Rijksen (revisions and testing)
- Simon Pauw (teaching and testing)
