In this module we'll get to work with *functions* and *random numbers*. With these Python components we can implement methdos that can determine the integral of just about any function! You don't need to have done any calculus to partake in this module, but some intuition with mathematical functions is quite relevant. 

Start out with the video to the side. Lydia Brenner and Jelle Aalbers are promoting ath the [Nikhef](http://www.nikhef.nl/) and tell you about their experiences with programming and coding simulations for their research.
