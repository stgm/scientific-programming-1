# Algorithms

In this module we'll be exercising with a couple ordinary programs and with creating graphs. The assignments display an array of typical algorithms and scratch the surface of mathematical knowledge. Approachable for betas, alphas and gammas alike!

For starters take a look at the video to the side. Egge van der Poel is a Data Scientist at the Erasmus MC en tells about his experience with programming and processing data in this hospital.
