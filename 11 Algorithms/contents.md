# Algorithms (level 1)

In this module you'll dip your toes into the water by implementing a few algorithms. These algorithms generate different outputs depending on what we provide as input. Seen that way, the algorithms are *generic*, albeit limited a particular kind of input. This module should be accessible with a high-school level background in mathematics.

But first, check out the short movie below. Egge van der Poel is a data scientist at the Erasmus MC Hospital en tells about his experience with programming and processing data from real patients.
